# Beautiful, lonely book seeks marketing genius

> A few years ago, we published a [brave, crazy book of Bible stories](https://www.facebook.com/wieisdit) for children in Afrikaans. We&nbsp;couldn't sell it. Can you?

We're looking for a small team of marketing students[*](# "or anyone keen and creative") to take on a real-life practical assignment. It'll test your creativity, your design skills, your ability to create great messaging, your social-media savvy, your strategic thinking and your customer-service smarts. And if you pull it off, you can keep all the profits.

*	We have over a thousand copies to sell.
*	You'll create a new dust-jacket and marketing material.
*	We'll provide a little seed cash, and let you spend sales revenue to grow.
*	You can use our infrastructure: office, phone, Internet, tea and bananas.

It takes a smart, keen team to sell a book. If you're up for it, mail [arthur@electricbookworks.com](mailto:arthur@electricbookworks.com).
